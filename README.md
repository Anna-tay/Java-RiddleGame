# Riddle Game - Over view 

This was my first time writing in java and it was so much fun. I wrote a small riddle game to be able to learn classes and the right syntax for java. This program asks you if you want to play then gives you a riddle to solve.

# Development Environment

I used java inside Visual studio Code. Some of the libraries I used was Scanner and Random. These allowed me to get user input and to get a random numer. At first I wrote with code with funciton and then split it up into classes.

# Future Work

* Get the classes to have getters and setters
* More hints in a growing order
* A file that reads the list into the program
