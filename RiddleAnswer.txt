I'm tall when I'm young, and I'm short when I'm old. What am I
What has a ring, but no finger?
What is always in front of you but can't be seen?
What has to be broken before you can use it?
What can't talk but will reply when spoken to?
I have branches, but no fruit, trunk or leaves. What am I?
Candle
phone
future
egg
echo
